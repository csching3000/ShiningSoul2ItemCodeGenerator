form to generate the cheat code to use for different items in the game

Created using .NET

I become tired of having to manaully edit the item code, so thought it would be worthwhile to create a form with a dropdown that would take the values I entered and spit out the code to use to hack the game.
The form consists of 5 different fields, two of which are dropdowns. Essentially what the form does is it takes the value I input, and parses, then either concatenates/replaces the default item code with the value
